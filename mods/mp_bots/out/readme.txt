If you want to install it as a mod:
1. Locate the root folder which your game is installed in.
2. Locate the 'mods' folder, if there isn't one, make it.
3. Move the 'mp_bots' folder found in the 'Move to mods folder' into the 'mods' folder.
4. The file/folder structure should be '.BORoot\mods\mp_bots\mp_bots.iwd'.
5. Simply run the game, go to the 'Mods' menu and select 'mp_bots'.
6. Thats it, go play!

If you want to rank up with the mod:
WARNING: Make sure to backup your patch_mp.ff and patch_ui_mp.ff files! You will not be able to play on servers with different FFs!
1. Locate the root folder which your game is installed in.
2. Go into the folder 'zone' and then into the folder 'Common'.
3. Move the two files 'patch_mp.ff' and 'patch_ui_mp.ff' from the 'Others' folder into the 'Common' folder, replacing the files.
4. Now run the game and the mod will be running by default. (No need to select the mod from the in-game menu)

///////////////3: FAQs/Notes//////////////
Q: DLC maps have no images (with rank up option)!
A: It appears Treyarch has put the materials for these maps in the original patch_mp.ff file. It is currently not known how to insert materials into a FF as they are streamed.

Q: I'm getting menu asset limit errors when I switch to a mod (with rank up option)!
A: The modified FFs have menu files in them. Restoring back to your original FF files will fix this.

TODO:
Make bots use remote helicopters, possible?
Make bots use alt weapon types (tube, master key, flamethrower) possible?
